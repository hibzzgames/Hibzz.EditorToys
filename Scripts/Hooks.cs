    // This is mostly a function for internal editor use only, however, if you
    // wish to use it for any other purpose, please thread carefully on how you
    // incorporate it into your code. This system isn't battle tested.

    // How does this system work?
    // Since its not possible to directly subscribe to the unity game events, I
    // created this system to subscribe to those events. The hooks are made
    // possible because when the editor loads, the system creates a new
    // gameobject with a singleton monobehavior in it that'll recieve the event
    // calls from Unity using the functions we know and route it to the
    // delegates. The gameobject is hidden from the end user, doesn't get saved
    // to the scene and doesn't get destroyed by the editor, so it's lifetime
    // is temporary.

    // It's kinda icky to do this, but I can't think of another way to
    // subscribe to those events. I had to make this entire package "non-editor"
    // to accomodate for this system, which sucks. I genuinly hate adding
    // #if UNITY_EDITOR everywhere. Without that this component can't be
    // attached to a gameobject to make this system work.

    // You know what would be cool? EditorBehavior! A monobehavior that exist
    // at editor time as well. If unity supports that, that would make my life
    // a lot more easier.

    // I have no idea how this system will behave at runtime, so I'm blocking
    // the creation of the object when the Instance property is accessed at
    // runtime. However, if you wish to experiment using the hooks for the
    // various systems in your game, please manually add the EditorToysHooks as
    // a component to a gameobject in the scene using some script. This would
    // prove your intent to use the system at runtime and prevent any
    // accidental creation of the object. Then, accessing the Instance variable
    // would work as expected and the static delegates will start firing the
    // events.
